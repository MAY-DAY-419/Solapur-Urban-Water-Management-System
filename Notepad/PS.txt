One-Line Problem Statement Design and develop a smart, 
data-driven water pressure monitoring and management system for 
Solapur Municipal Corporation (SMC) to ensure equitable, reliable, 
and efficient water supply across all distribution zones through 
real-time monitoring, analytics, and automation. Context 
Solapur Municipal Corporation provides drinking water to 
more than 10 lakh citizens across multiple water distribution zones. 
Despite continuous infrastructure development and operational efforts, 
the city continues to face challenges related to uneven water pressure, 
irregular supply, and significant water losses. Areas located at higher 
elevations and tail-end zones frequently experience low water pressure and 
inadequate supply, leading to citizen dissatisfaction and inequitable access. 
Additionally, aging pipelines, leakages, unauthorized consumption, 
and manual valve operations result in high non-revenue water 
and operational inefficiencies. The absence of real-time monitoring, 
automation, and data-driven decision support limits SMC's ability to respond 
proactively and plan efficiently, necessitating the adoption of smart water management 
solutions. Problem Description Solapur Municipal Corporation requires an integrated, 
intelligent water management solution to address the following challenges: 
1. Uneven Water Pressure and Distribution • Low pressure in elevated and tail-end areas. 
• Unequal water distribution across zones and wards. 
• Irregular and unpredictable water supply schedules. 
2. Water Losses and Infrastructure Inefficiencies • Leakages and bursts in aging pipelines. 
• Manual valve and pump operations leading to human error. 
• Unauthorized consumption and undetected losses. 
3. Lack of Real-Time Visibility and Decision Support 
• No real-time data on pressure, flow, and consumption patterns. 
• Delayed detection of faults and pressure drops. 
• Limited analytical tools for demand forecasting and planning.
